# Salesforce-Weather-Forecast-App-Integration
A Salesforce Lightning Web Component (LWC) application that integrates with an external Weather API using Apex REST callouts and Named Credentials. The app fetches real-time weather data, allows saving forecasts asynchronously with Queueable Apex, and displays stored weather reports in a Lightning Data Table.
